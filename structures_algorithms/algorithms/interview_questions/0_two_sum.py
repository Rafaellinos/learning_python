"""
Given an array of integers, return the indices of the two numbers that
add up to a given target

ex: [1,3,7,9,2] => 11

1. First thing: Check constraints:
    ex: There is duplicates? All numbers are duplicates? There may not always be a solution

2. Write out some teste cases:

"""
from typing import List


def return_indexes(nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    new_list = []

    ...


print(return_indexes([1, 3, 7, 9, 2]))
